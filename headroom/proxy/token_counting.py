"""Offloaded token-count helpers shared by proxy handlers.

Tokenizer resolution can be expensive on first use (HuggingFace backends may
download vocab files) and counting a full Claude Code conversation is CPU-bound,
so both run on the caller's compression executor bounded by
``COMPRESSION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` (GH #1701: an unbounded on-loop load froze the
whole server). On timeout, error, or a missing executor this fails open to
character-based estimation.

Shared by every provider handler mixin (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini): the OpenAI
``/v1/chat/completions`` and ``/v1/responses`` endpoints are multi-provider
passthroughs, so an HF-routed model (qwen, deepseek, llama, ...) can reach them
and trigger the same cold load.
