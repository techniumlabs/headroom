"""Shared fixtures for the CLI test suite.

``headroom wrap`` may fetch helper binaries (e.g. rtk, lean-ctx) over the
network via ``headroom.binaries``. Force offline across CLI tests so a missing
binary resolves locally instead of reaching out to GitHub releases. Tests that
exercise a binary-present path patch the relevant resolver directly and are
unaffected by this guard.
